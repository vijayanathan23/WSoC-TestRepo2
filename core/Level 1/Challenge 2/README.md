# Challenge 2

## To Do

<!--- Once you are completed with a task, you can mark it as done on this to do list.
      To do that, just add an x between the square brackets.
      Example : [ ] becomes [x] -->

- [X] Create a dictionary of lists.

- [X] Save the dictionary object into a pickle file (create one inside the "Challenge 2" folder).

- [X] Read the contents of the pickle file and update a list within the dictionary.

- [X] Save the dictionary into the pickle file again.

- [X] Take a screenshot of the output(content in the pickle file before and after updating) and save it with the names "before updating" and "after updating".
