# Challenge 1

## To Do

<!--- Once you are completed with a task, you can mark it as done on this to do list.
      To do that, just add an x between the square brackets.
      Example : [ ] becomes [x] -->

- [X] Read the contents from the "Data.pkl" file present within the folder. 

- [X] Create two seperate lists to hold the keys and values from the dictionary. 

- [X] Build a Bar graph from the data obtained.

- [X] Build a Pie chart from the data obtained.

- [X] Take a screenshot of each of the graphs and save them as "Bar graph" and "Pie chart".

**NOTE:** Do not manually enter data into the list in step 2. Be creative.
